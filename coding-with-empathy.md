# Coding with empathy

> _If your project does not follow these guidelines, be sure to describe the reasons in the readme, and provide as much context and guidance as possible._

## Principles

-   you are coding for the people you work with (including future you)
-   the less we need to know to be useful, the more we can do

## Recommendations

-   optimise your project for Guardian engineers
    -   prefer programming languages and frameworks that are commonly used at the Guardian
-   optimise your code for people who are familiar with the language it is written in
    -   prefer idiomatic patterns and techniques
-   optimise your code for the next reader
    - simplicity > sophistication
