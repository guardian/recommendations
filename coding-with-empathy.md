# Coding with empathy

> _If your project does not follow these guidelines, be sure to describe the reasons in the readme, and provide as much context and guidance as possible._

## Principles

-   you are coding for the people you work with (including future you)
-   the less we need to know to be useful, the more we can do

## Recommendations

-   prefer programming languages and frameworks that are commonly used at the Guardian
    -   this will optimise your project for Guardian engineers
-   prefer idiomatic patterns and techniques
    -   this will optimise your code for people who are already familiar with the language it is written in
- prefer simplicity over sophistication
    -   this will optimise your code for the next reader
-   defer to [the principle of least surprise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment)
    -   our code should make the reader feel capable rather out of their depth
