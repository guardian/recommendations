This file is auto-generated via `best-practice/generate.sh`. Do not edit it directly, but instead run `./best-practice/generate.sh`.

This document defines a list of best practices we have defined.

An Owner is someone/a team that is responsible for tracking compliance of the best practice. They can also be approached for guidance on how to adhere. Typically this will be a DevX team.
