Scala
-----

 * Always specify an explicit sbt.version
 * Ensure you run in production with GC logging enabled
 * Prefer immutability
 * Prefer the latest version of Scala. At the time of writing `3.1.2` is the latest version, so `2.13.8` may be acceptable. if you are still using `2.12.x` you should plan to migrate.
 * If some dependencies are unavailable for the latest version, it is acceptable to use the latest patch version of the previous minor version but try to avoid it. If you have a dependency that isn't available for one of these versions, it's effectively dead and you should plan how to move away from it. 
 * If you come to a codebase using an older version of Scala, it should be upgraded before any new features are added.
 * Run on a version of the JVM with LTS and with public updates. At the time of writing this means either `JDK17`, `JDK11` or `JDK8`. Recommendation is to use the `JDK11`.
 * Avoid dependency injection in general. 
 
[Dependency injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection) is a software design pattern that implements [inversion of control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control) between a `client` and a `service` for resolving dependencies. The term `injection` refers to a third party (named `the injector`) which is responsible for constructing the services and injecting them into the client. Usual `injectors`are dependency injection frameworks such as `guice`, `dagger`, `macwire`, `spring`. 

Instead of `injecting` your dependencies, you should simply [pass them as parameters](http://debasishg.blogspot.com/2011/03/pushing-envelope-on-oo-and-functional.html) of functions you are calling. This enable [referential transparency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_transparency) of your programs.

Most of the time, dependency injection does not solve a real business problem. You don't need to have a single place where you define which concrete instance your trait should be used. This is`accidental complexity`, as coined by Fred Brooks in [No Silver Bullet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet)  

With [The play framework](https://www.playframework.com/) you should always use [compile-time dependency injection](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.5.x/ScalaCompileTimeDependencyInjection) which refers to an object oriented way to specify your components declaratively in scala.
